# LINUX RICE üçö

## Introduction

Welcome to my Linux rice setup! I‚Äôm running Fedora as my base operating system.
I‚Äôve customized GNOME, enhancing its already sleek design with a curated selection of extensions to achieve a clean and elegant aesthetic.
The goal of my setup is to combine minimalism and functionality, creating a workspace that not only looks stunning but also boosts productivity.
By carefully tweaking GNOME‚Äôs appearance and functionality, I‚Äôve crafted a system that reflects both simplicity and sophistication.
This setup is perfect for anyone who values beauty and efficiency in their Linux environment.
